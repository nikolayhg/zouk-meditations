Mind blown. Dancing is sooo vast. Can be experienced, perceived, analyzed, categorized in sooo many ways. As many senses we have, as deep and as wide they are and we let them be. So many body and mind models. The more I reflect on dancing the wider and deeper its endless realities reveal themselves.

It is so amazing.

And that's only from human point of view. When you start to imagine and reflect beyond humans you experience even more exponential revealing of dancing realities.

You start to see existence patterns. You naturally forget about your previous limited concepts of dancing and expand into life itself. Almost like dancing becomes and has always been life.
