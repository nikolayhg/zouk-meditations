\- How was your day?

\- I was practicing the Art of Following.

\- Art of Following? Can you explain?

\- I followed the beautiful singing of birds in the morning and I woke up. I saw that the sun is about to rise and prepared myself to greet it by going to the beach. Once the sun began rising I was following visually its movement on the surface of water. As I was near the water I followed the desires of my feet to feel the water. As my feet were in the water I followed the desire of my whole body to get into the water. Then I followed the desire to swim. Then I followed the desire to get out of the water and run on the fine beach. Afterwards I saw people dancing in a circle, I followed the desire to join them and I followed their moves while dancing. Pure simple following of nature and life.

\- That's so Zooouuuk!
